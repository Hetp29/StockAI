# StockAI
Statistical arbitrage is when we trade two stocks, and if one goes up while other goes down, we bet that their prices will return to their normal relationship, making a profit from the difference.
Ex. Coca-cola (KO) and PepsiCo(PEP): If pepsi's price drops while Coke's stays high, we buy pepsi and short (sell) coke, expecting their prices to come together.
